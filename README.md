# Reinforcement-Learning-UNIPI-paper-review
Presentation research papers on the topic of "The Evolution of Feudal Reinforcement Learning". I have covered the following three papers.

- [Feudal Reinforcement Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1992/file/d14220ee66aeec73c49038385428ec4c-Paper.pdf). Hinton et al., 1993.
- [FeUdal Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01161). Vezhnevets et al., 2017.
- [Feudal Multi-Agent Hierarchies for Cooperative Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08492). Sanjeevan Ahilan and Peter Dayan, 2019.

Thank you.
