# Reinforcement Learning - UNIPI
Course of Reinforcement Learning, University of Pisa, A.Y. 2020/21

## Materials
In this folder you can find my [final presentation](https://github.com/marcopetix/Reinforcement-Learning-UNIPI-paper-review/blob/main/Feudal%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20-%20Petix%20.pdf) on the topic of "The Evolution of Feudal Reinforcement Learning". 

I have covered the following three papers:
- [Feudal Reinforcement Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1992/file/d14220ee66aeec73c49038385428ec4c-Paper.pdf). Hinton et al., 1993.
- [FeUdal Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01161). Vezhnevets et al., 2017.
- [Feudal Multi-Agent Hierarchies for Cooperative Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08492). Sanjeevan Ahilan and Peter Dayan, 2019.

Thank you.
