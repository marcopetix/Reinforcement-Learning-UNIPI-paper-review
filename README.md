# Reinforcement-Learning-UNIPI-paper-review
Presentation research papers on the topic of "The Evolution of Feudal Reinforcement Learning" for Reinforcement learning. I have covered the following three papers. All three papers uses different techniques to transfer knowledge from previously learned task and achieved a good result.

Feudal Reinforcement Learning. Hinton et al., 1993.
